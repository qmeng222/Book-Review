        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time
          and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored
          to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies
          that make learning easier.

        <h3>My review</h3>
        <p>
          Every "student" should have, read and keep this book. It has been a
          long time since I have been a student in the going-to-school sense,
          but as an old guy who still loves to learn, this book is still
          relevant. In my case, it has caused me to look back at my "school"
          times and other formal learning to highlight how I was able to do as
          well as I did and how I could have done better with the guidance of
          this book. Some of the guidance is rather obvious, but confirming:
          early and repeated retrieval, the value of formal testing, fallacy of
          simply re-reading. Other of the guidance is somewhat surprising:
          interleaving, mixing up attention to and study of different material,
          the value of not understanding immediately and having to work through
          material to highlight and deepen the learning. This is a treasure of a
          book and I plan on getting a bunch of copies to give (as Christmas
          gifts!) to my grand kids and even several of my younger sons who are
          in graduate school.
